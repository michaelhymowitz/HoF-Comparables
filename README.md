# HoF-Comparables
This is a personal project in Python trying to find MLB players who are not in the Hall of Fame who are of a similar level to the average HoFer.

In this project, I find the average BA, OBP, SLG, OPS, ISO, BABIP, SB% for all position players in the HoF, and the average ERA, WHIP, H/9, HR/9, BB%, K%, K/BB for all pitchers in the HoF. Then, I find which MLB players post-1961 (the beginning of MLB's Expansion Era) are not in the HoF as of 2018 who are at least of a similar level in all these statistics are not in the HoF. These players have statistics that are at least comparable to the "stereotypical" HoFer.
