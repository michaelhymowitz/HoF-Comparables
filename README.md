# HoF-Comparables
This is a personal project in Python trying to find MLB players who are not in the Hall of Fame who are of a similar level to the average Hall of Famer.

In this project, I find the average BA, OBP, SLG, OPS, ISO, BABIP, SB% for all position players in the Hall of Fame, and the average ERA, WHIP, H/9, HR/9, K%, BB%, K/BB for all pitchers in the Hall of Fame. Then, I find which MLB players post-1961 (the beginning of MLB's Expansion Era) are not in the Hall of Fame as of 2018 who are at least of a similar level in all these statistics are not in the Hall of Fame. These players have statistics that are at least comparable to the "stereotypical" Hall of Famer.

Data came from Sean Lahman's 2018 Baseball Database (link: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/)
